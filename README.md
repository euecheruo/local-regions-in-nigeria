Geographical data points of locations in Nigeria

I have decided to use a hybrid of the slug text convention in the naming of the locations, which rules are as listed below:

- Each location within a region must have a unique name. For example, there cannot be two towns called "Gwarinpa" within an LGA called "Abuja" in the state of "Federal Capital Territory," nor can there be two cities called "Lagos" within an LGA called "Lagos" in the state of "Lagos."
- Each location must have the names of subregion locations within them that are unique. If the names of subregions with the same location are the same, one of the locations should be considered a duplicate and be deleted or removed.
- All names of locations must start with a capital letter followed by small letters. As such, "Gwagwalada".
- All names of locations that have the conjunction "and" or "&" should be prohibited. There cannot, for example, be "Isheri-Olowo-Ira/Shangisha/Magodo Phase I & II". Instead, the location should be named "Isheri Olowo Ira-Shangisha-Magodo Phase I-Magodo Phase II".
- If the name of the location has two or more words, then the words should be separated by a space. As such, "Mkpat Enin".
- If the name used for the location is made up of names for two or more different locations, The names must be separated by a hyphen [-], with no spaces between the words. As such, "Abua-Odual".
- If the name of the location contains a number, the number must be represented in Roman numerals. As such, "Akpa II"
- Special characters such as [/_;:#@&*()!+=] are not permitted in the location's name.
- A single quote ['] is allowed in the naming of a location. As such, "Jema'a".
- Alternative or old names used in naming the location should be prohibited. A location should have only one officially recognized name.
- Abbreviations of words in the name of a location are prohibited. Each word must be spelled out in full. As such,
- Adding an adjective to the name of a location is prohibited. The name "Owerri Municipal" is not allowed, "Owerri" is used instead.
- A location name cannot be only a numerical number.
