Geographical data points of locations in Nigeria

I have decided to use a hybrid of the slug text convention in the naming of the locations, which rules are as listed as follows below:

- Each location within a region must have a unique name. There cannot, for example, be two towns called "Gwarinpa" within an LGA called "Abuja" in the state of "Federal Capital Territory", or two cities called "Lagos" within an LGA called "Lagos" in the state of "Lagos". 
- Each location must have the names of subregion locations within them that are unique. If the names of subregions with the same location are the same, one of the locations should be considered a duplicate and be deleted or removed. 
- All names of locations must start with a capital letter followed by small letters. As such, "Gwagwalada".
- If the name of the location has 2 or more words, then the words should be separated by a space. As such, "Mkpat Enin".
- If the name used for the location is made up of names for 2 or more different locations. The names must be separated by a hyphen [-], with no spaces between the words. As such, "Abua-Odual".
- If the name of the location contains a number, the number must be represented in Roman numerals. As such, "Akpa II"
- Special characters like [/\_;:^#@&*()!~`+=] are prohibited in naming the location.
- A single quote ['] is allowed in the naming of a location. As such, "Jema'a".
- Alternative or old names used in naming the location should be prohibited. A location should have only one officially recognized name.
- Abbreviations of words in the name of a location are prohibited. Each word must be spelled out in full. As such,  
- Adding an adjective in the name of a location is prohibited. The name "Owerri Municipal" is not allowed, "Owerri" is used instead.
- A name of a location CANNOT be only a numerical number.
