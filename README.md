# Standardized Location Naming Conventions for States, Local Government Areas (LGA)/counties, Cities/Towns, Districts, Council Areas, and Wards in Nigeria

## I. Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)
* **Uniqueness (Priority 1):** Every location name must be unique within its parent region (e.g., LGA within a State). This rule overrides all others. If applying any other rule creates a name conflict, the differentiating word must be retained.
* **Case Consistency:** All names must start with a capital letter followed by small letters (e.g., Gwagwalada).
    * **Single Quote Exception:** In names containing a single quote ('), the letter immediately following the quote must be **lowercase** (e.g., *Jema'a*, not *Jema'A*), as the quote denotes a native language character rather than a punctuation mark.

## II. Word and Structure Formatting
* **Multi-Word Spacing:** If the name has two or more distinct words, they must be separated by a single space (e.g., Mkpat Enin), unless they fall under the Compound Location rule.
* **Compound Location Hyphen:** Names representing two or more merged, historical locations must separate the constituent names with a hyphen (-), with no spaces (e.g., *Abua-Odual*, *Akoko-Edo*).
* **Conjunction Prohibition:** The words "and" or the symbol "&" are strictly prohibited.
    * *Expansion Rule:* Where a conjunction connects two numbered entities (e.g., "Ward 1 & 2"), the name must be expanded and separated by a hyphen (e.g., *Ward I - Ward II*).
* **Number Representation:** All numerical digits in the name must be converted to and represented using Roman numerals (e.g., *Akpa 2* becomes *Akpa II*).

## III. Prohibited Elements (Clarity and Consistency)
* **Redundant Adjectives:** Adjectives or descriptors that define *what* the location is (e.g., *Municipal, City, District, Town, Village, L.G.A, Council, Area*) are considered redundant and must be removed.
    * *Exceptions:* **Estate**, **Layout**, **Quarters**, and **Hall** are valid address descriptors and must be retained (e.g., *Umunomo Hall*).
* **Directional Words:** Directional words (*East, West, North, South, Central*) are **PERMITTED** and should be retained to ensure uniqueness or accurately describe the location.
* **Special Characters:** All special characters (such as `/`, `\`, `_`, `;`, `:`, `#`, `@`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `!`, `+`, `=`) are prohibited.
    * *Replacement:* If a special character (like `/` or `&`) is used as a separator, it should be replaced with a hyphen (`-`).
    * The single quote (') is the only permitted exception.
* **Alternative Names:** Alternative or old names, misspellings, or local slang names are prohibited. Only the officially recognized name is allowed.
* **Abbreviations:** Abbreviations of words in the name of a location are prohibited. Each word must be spelled out in full (e.g., *Govt* becomes *Government*).
* **Language Translation:** Local language abbreviations or terms functioning as descriptors should be translated to their English equivalent to ensure accessibility (e.g., *Sabon Gari* or *S/G* becomes **Newtown**; *Tudun Wada* becomes **Wealth Hill**).
* **Numerals Only:** A location name cannot consist of only a numerical number.
